      <h2>CS636 Homework 1 Review, Setup, and Intro/Review of JDBC</h2>
      <p>Due Monday, Feb. 10, in class, on paper. Be sure to get a UNIX/Linux
        account as soon as possible after the departmental site is up, to list
        your username for the needed Oracle and mysql accounts, and access to
        topcat.cs.umb.edu.<br>
        <br>
        1. &nbsp;Basic HTML and URLs, intro to web apps.</p>
      <div>
        <p>--Learn about absolute and relative URLs, say by looking at this <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL"
            target="_blank"> tutorial on URLs</a> and looking at the examples in
          Murach, pg. 101.<br>
          --Read Murach, Chap. 1, through pg. 17 for an intro to web apps.<br>
          --Read Murach, Chap. 4 through pg. 105.&nbsp;We will go on to CSS and
          HTML forms in the next homework. </p>
      </div>
      Use a plain editor like emacs or Notepad to compose a web page test1.html
      with page title "Mytitle", contents entitled "Important links", and a
      relative link to a copy of this file (hw1.html), and an absolute link to
      the root of our departmental website, with appropriate descriptive
      text&nbsp;for the user to see. &nbsp;Include the text of test1.html in
      your homework submission.<br>
      <p> </p>
      <p>2. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Review SQL</span>. Read Murach pp.
        364-373.&nbsp;Go to <a href="http://sqlzoo.net">sqlzoo.net</a>,&nbsp;
        Pull down the Tutorials menu, and select the following tutorials:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Select from nobel:&nbsp; 4, 7&nbsp; (number them&nbsp; 1-4,
          1-7)&nbsp; For 7, use LIKE</li>
        <li> Select within select: &nbsp;2, 4, 6&nbsp;&nbsp;(2-2, etc.)</li>
        <li> Sum and count: 2, 4, 6</li>
        <li> More Joins: 3, 6, 7, 9 </li>
      </ul>
      Show your answers (copy and paste the SQL into your homework file). If an
      error message seems useless, try another database for the query--it might
      give better error messages.
      <p>3. Review <span style="font-weight: bold;">Java OO principles</span>,
        specifically the idea that <i>all Java classes are subclasses of the
          Object class</i>, and thus must have all the methods of the Object
        class. You can see the Object class API (and any other standard class)
        by following the link "JDK API" on the class web page under Resources
        Java (6<sup>th</sup> line down under Resources). Choose “Object” in the
        pane titled All Classes, and the API will be displayed on the right.<br>
        a. What are the three most important Object methods?&nbsp; (Hint: their
        names start with e, h, and t). Because all objects have these methods,
        we can use HashSet to contain any set of objects (we'll stick to sets of
        same-type objects in our work).<br>
        b. Show equals in use by writing one if (…) that checks whether s String
        s is equal to a String t, character by character.&nbsp; Explain what
        this comparison is doing if s = “abc” and t = “abx”.&nbsp; Compare this
        to what happens in if (s == t).<br>
        c.&nbsp; Find the hashCode and toString values for String s =
        “abc”.&nbsp; Also for the Integer of value 6.</p>
      <p>4<b>. Java Beans.</b> a. Write a small Java class Box1.java that has
        private int fields x, y for the dimensions of the (2-dimensional) box in
        mm. Give it getters and setters for x and y, and a simple constructor
        that takes x and y values, but no other methods. This is a simple “Java
        Bean”.&nbsp; For Box1 objects b and c, separately created but both
        describing 10x12 boxes, what is b.equals(c)? What is being compared
        here?<br>
        b. For Java class Box2.java, start from the Box1.java code and add an
        equals method that compares the x’s and y’s of the two Box2 objects to
        see if they are both the same or not.&nbsp; Make sure your equals method
        overrides Object.equals by using the annotation @Override (it’s easy to
        go wrong here). For an example, see <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overriding-equals-method-in-java/">
          http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overriding-equals-method-in-java/</a>.Write
        a hashCode method that is consistent with your equals method.&nbsp;
        Consistent here means satisfying the second bulleted requirement under
        the Object.hashCode documentation, namely “If two objects are equal
        according to the&nbsp;equals(Object)&nbsp;method, then calling
        the&nbsp;hashCode&nbsp;method on each of the two objects must produce
        the same integer result.” <br>
        c. Finally, write a toString method that returns “10x12” for a 10 by 12
        box.&nbsp; For Box2 objects b and c, separately created but both
        describing 10x12 boxes, what is b.equals(c)?<br>
        <br>
        5. Review<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Java Collection classe</span>s.
        &nbsp;Look at the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/collections/">
          Collection Framework home page</a> at Oracle, and from there the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/collections/overview.html">
          Collections Framework Overview</a> and Collections Tutorial, for
        Java&nbsp;8. &nbsp;.<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/collections/changes5.html"><br>
        </a>a. &nbsp;What are the two most important concrete classes that are
        available for the Set interface? &nbsp;the Map interface?<br>
        b. &nbsp;Explain how you can find all the&nbsp;elements of a given Set
        object. &nbsp;Does your answer also apply to Lists? &nbsp;other things?
        &nbsp;what class of objects?<br>
        c. &nbsp;Explain how you can find all the keys of a given Map.<br>
        d. &nbsp;Write a Java fragment that creates a Map from String to
        Integer. Add the association "x" -&gt; 6, that is, key "x" maps to
        Integer 6.</p>
      6. &nbsp;Start learning (or review) JDBC. Read Murach, Chap. 12 through
      pg. 387, and the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/index.html">
        Oracle tutorial on basic JDBC</a>, specifically the sections named
      “Setting Up Tables” and “Retrieving and Modifying Values from Result
      Sets”, mainly the first example.<br>
      a. What Java classes (include package name) support JDBC and are used in
      the Oracle tutorial section “Setting Up Tables”? &nbsp;For each, briefly
      explain what it provides. Note that con is assumed to be an available
      field of type Connection.<br>
      b. Do you need a new Connection for each SQL statement? &nbsp;Explain.<br>
      c. &nbsp;Find the JDBC API documentation among the usual JSE Javadocs at <a
        href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/</a>.
      &nbsp;In particular, read Connection.close() and explain what it means.
      &nbsp;The "resources" here involve the TCP/IP connection to the database,
      an OS resource not directly managed the the Java vitual machine (JVM.)<br>
      d. &nbsp;Explain how to use the "getXXX" methods. &nbsp;What getXXX
      methods would you normally use with a VARCHAR(100) column? &nbsp;a FLOAT
      column? &nbsp;a DECIMAL(7,2) column? a TIMESTAMP column? Explain what
      these SQL datatypes mean, and give two examples of valid SQL literal
      values for each. For detailed info on JDBC and SQL datatypes, see&nbsp; <a
        href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jdbc/getstart/mapping.html">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jdbc/getstart/mapping.html.</a></div>

      Report on your <a href="DevelopmentSetup.html">DevelopmentSetup</a>
      progress and/or problems (This file is available at our Piazza site).
      &nbsp;Show your final "env" and "set" output, or the relevant subset of
      it.&nbsp;You may use Netbeans rather than eclipse if you want, but class
      demos and directions will be using eclipse. Also, Netbeans does not
      support multi-directory source comparison, which we will occasionally use.</div>
    <div class="WordSection1"><br>
    </div>
    <div class="WordSection1"><b>Note:</b> the following problems depend on our
      cs.umb.edu network being available, so may need to be postponed. The
      previous problems are definitely due on the due date, unless we have a
      snow day or other class disruption.</div>

    <div class="WordSection1"> 8.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Oracle.</span>&nbsp;
      After you have verified your Oracle account is working by logging in to
      system topcat.cs.umb.edu and using sqlplus as shown in <a href="DatabaseSetup.html">DatabaseSetup.html</a>,
      try accessing it with the supplied program <a href="http://www.cs.umb.edu/cs636/jdbc">JdbcCheckup</a>.
      See <a href="AccessToCSHosts.html">Access to cs.umb.edu systems from
        offsite</a> for instructions on logging in from offsite. Note that you
      can run JdbcCheckup on any of our UNIX/Linux hosts, or on your home PC,
      and reach Oracle on dbs3. From outside cs.umb.edu, you need to set up a
      "tunnel" to dbs3, as described in <a href="DatabaseSetup.html">Database
        Setup</a>. Once JdbcCheckup works, log into topcat and run sqlplus and
      record what tables have been created by the JDBC program by using the
      catalog query "select * from user_tables" or just "select table_name from
      user_tables" to get a less verbose report. Note that the jars supplied
      with JdbcCheckup work equally well on Windows/Linux/MacOS as on
      UNIX/Linux. Try it out on both your home PC and your departmental Linux
      account.<br>
      <p> 9.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Mysql.</span><br>
        User ronghui, for example, will have an account on mysql on topcat with
        username ronghui, password ronghui, and a database named
        ronghuidb.&nbsp; To access it, login to topcat.cs.umb.edu and use the
        command:</p>
      <p><code>mysql –u ronghui –D ronghuidb –p</code></p>
      <p>and enter ronghui at the password prompt.&nbsp; Another way is shown on
        pg. 351 of Murach:</p>
      <code>mysql –u ronghui –p</code><br>
      Enter password:<code> ronghui<br>
        use ronghuidb</code>
      <p>Similarly run JdbcCheckup on your mysql account. &nbsp;You can log in
        on topcat and use the mysql command to look at the database. Also try
        out hsqldb (see header comment on JdbcCheckup.java for directions).
        Record your success or problems.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>10.a. Try out the Data Source Explorer view in eclipse. Click on the
        "New Connection Profile" icon (it has a little plus on it) in the Data
        Source Explorer view, and add a new Connection to localhost (and have
        the tunnel working), with driver MySQL (with driver jar from the jdbc
        directory), Database xxxxdb, URL jdbc:mysql://localhost/xxxxdb, and User
        name xxxx, where xxxx is your username. &nbsp;See your welcome table
        there. Record your success or problems.<br>
        b. Similarly set up an eclipse Connection to Oracle and view your
        welcome table there, and similarly for h2 </p>
